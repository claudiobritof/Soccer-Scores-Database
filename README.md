# Meetings-Calendar
Make scheduling meetings faster and more practical.  
  
&emsp;Problem: I used to work on a tech-project team with 3 other members. As, by the time, we lived in different cities, our meetings were always online, and we always lost too much time and spent too much energy scheduling it.  
  
&emsp;To solve this unproductive task, this project facilitated the convergence of schedules between members of both front-end and back-end teams, by displaying the meeting schedule for each day of a work week. It uses a set of imported modules and defines meeting times for each day, following each members' personal schedule.

<b>Prerequisites:  </b>  
  
To run this project, you just need to have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.  

<b>Setup:  </b>  
1. Clone the project repository or copy the code into a Python file.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The code relies on the defs module and imports monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, and friday. Those contains members' schedule.
3. Run the Python script using your preferred method (e.g., command line, IDE, etc.).

<b>Usage:  </b>  
  
Upon running the script, the program will display the meeting schedule for each day of the week. The meeting times are divided into three categories: Front-End, Back-End, and SENA (Front and Back teams together).  

The meeting times are printed in the following format:  

&emsp;[Day of the Week] Meeting Time  
&emsp;Front-end: [Front-End Meeting Time]  
&emsp;Back-end: [Back-End Meeting Time]  
&emsp;SENA: [SENA Meeting Time]  
  
For example:  
  
&emsp;MONDAY Meeting Time  
&emsp;Front-end: 09:00  
&emsp;Back-end: 10:30  
&emsp;SENA: 11:45  
  
The program also specifies the duration of each meeting, which is set to 30 minutes.
